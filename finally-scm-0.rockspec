  detailed = [[
    'finally' in other languages is used to ensure execution of a
    certain piece of code even if an error/exception is thrown
    (usually for deterministic cleanup of resources). This module
    provides a function that emulates the 'finally' language
    feature of those other programming languages in Lua.
